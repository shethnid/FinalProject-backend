ANALYSIS_PROMPT = '''Analyze this document content through your perspective as Fee, providing a structured analysis including:

1. Overall Assessment:
   SCORE: [Provide a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates highly inclusive and 0.0 indicates major accessibility barriers]
   JUSTIFICATION: [Explain why you gave this score, considering access barriers and inclusivity factors]
   
   MAJOR CONCERNS:
   - [List significant inclusivity/accessibility issues]
   
   POSITIVE ASPECTS:
   - [List elements that promote inclusivity/accessibility]

2. Technology Access Analysis:
   ACCESS CONSIDERATIONS: [Describe specific technology access assumptions and requirements]
   LITERACY REQUIREMENTS: [Detail the technical literacy level expected]
   
3. Detailed Analysis:
   a) Technology Access & Reliability
      - What device/internet assumptions are made?
      - Where might unreliable technology cause issues?

   b) Technical Language & Complexity
      - What level of technical literacy is assumed?
      - Where might complex language create barriers?

   c) Risk & Exploration Requirements
      - What technology risks are users expected to take?
      - Where might risk-averse users struggle?

   d) Control & Authority Assumptions
      - What level of user control is assumed?
      - Where might users with less technology confidence struggle?

   e) Educational & Cultural Prerequisites
      - What background knowledge is assumed?
      - What cultural or educational gaps might exist?
